Ok, so the player movement is going to be reset to the original, because I am sick and tired of it. It might be laggy on my computer but at least it's consistent on normal / faster computers.

I am trying the puzzle mechanic where you have boxes and pressure plates but one door per .lvl file. (because multiple .lvl files can also be a part of one large puzzle).

I'll work on the box physics for today.
