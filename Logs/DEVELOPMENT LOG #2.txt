LOG #2
======

I am planning to write the base code for the puzzle mechanic
today.

The idea is that, since I can't make an entity that when pressed, creates a new player object, I will just make the levels have the player objects already instantiated in the .lvl file. For the puzzles itself, there would be a single door per level, except that different .lvl files would be classified as one level, since I can't have more than one door per .lvl file.

First thing TODO: Make so that when you go back into another level, the second instance of the player is exactly where you left them.

END LOG #2

alright lets get to work! The aftermath of the code would be
explained in LOG #3.
