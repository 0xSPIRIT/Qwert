LOG #1
======

This is the first in a set of many game dev logs on my game
'QWert'. The name would most likely be renamed later on.

I've recently commited a new fix for the movement of the player.
Before, if your fps is low (dt), then the movement would be choppy and would allow you to clip through walls.

I fixed this issue by asking if the difference of movement between two frames are too large, then cap off the speed to a lower value. This has massively helped for lower-end machines like mine.

Another big problem I've encountered is that on higher-end machines, the jumping seems to be a noticable amount faster than on a slow machine. This is because since the higher-end machines
are running a lot more frames per second, there would be a higher number of gravity calculations per second. To fix this issue, my theory is to multiply the gravity by a deltatime, but even that seems to be not fixing the problem. Or maybe I'm just doing it wrong.

wow i just realized how serious this seems.
welp, <insert fart joke here>
